## ROS Workspaces: manipulators_xarm
### Solution to the pick and place activity using both arms. In order to change robot models you have to follow these steps
### 1) Adjust Gazebo simulation to avoid collisions in the initial pose
### 2) Check that all frames are aligned proplery and publish static transforms to solve that if necessary (example in launchfile)
### 3) Change planning groups in solution.py to match moveit definitions that can be seen in RViz
### Links to aditional documentation can be found in the powe point
